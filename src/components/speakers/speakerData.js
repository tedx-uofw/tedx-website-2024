//             Aramis O. Hamer is a visual artist and muralist in Seattle, WA. 
//             Her large-scale, acrylic paintings are inspired by the cosmos, 
//             music, nature, divine femininity, and the complexities in Black 
//             culture. Aramis has exhibited her colorful creations throughout 
//             Washington state. She also painted the “V” in Seattle’s Black 
//             Lives Matter mural. This self taught, Neddy Award winning-artist 
//             lets her imagination be her guide.
