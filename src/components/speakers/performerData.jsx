        description: <p>
            Traditional Chinese Dance at UW was founded in 2021 with the mission
            to spread Chinese culture in the UW and Seattle communities through
            dance performances and events! Follow them on Instagram at @tcduw to
            follow their journey throughout the year as they hold quarterly free
            workshops and perform at other events until their very own end-of-year
            showcase in May! At the TEDxUofW conference, they will be performing a
            piece called "Heavenly Shower." The style and story behind this dance
            originates from Tibet, a region in China known as the "roof of the world"
            because it is the highest region on Earth. In Tibetan culture, there is a
            traditional bathing custom called the Heavenly Shower. According to legend,
            this shower helps get rid of filth, diseases, and sins on the body, because
            the spring water on the high mountains represent peace, happiness, and a
            blessing from the gods. In this Heavenly Shower, men and women bathe together
            facing Buddha and the gods, and everyone is free, open, and harmonious with
            nature. It really is a beautiful rendition of human and nature living in harmony.
            We hope you enjoy this dance!
