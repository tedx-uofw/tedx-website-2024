            Vocal Jazz at UW is a student run choral group. Vocal Jazz at UW 
            aims to bring together vocalists and instrumentalists to perform 
            vocal arrangements of jazz both new and old. We enjoy making music

            Traditional Chinese Dance at UW was founded in 2021 with the mission 
            to spread Chinese culture in the UW and Seattle communities through 
            dance performances and events! Follow them on Instagram at @tcduw to 
            follow their journey throughout the year as they hold quarterly free 
            workshops and perform at other events until their very own end-of-year 
            showcase in May! At the TEDxUofW conference, they will be performing a 
            piece called "Heavenly Shower." The style and story behind this dance 
            originates from Tibet, a region in China known as the "roof of the world" 
            because it is the highest region on Earth. In Tibetan culture, there is a 
            traditional bathing custom called the Heavenly Shower. According to legend, 
            this shower helps get rid of filth, diseases, and sins on the body, because 
            the spring water on the high mountains represent peace, happiness, and a 
            blessing from the gods. In this Heavenly Shower, men and women bathe together 
            facing Buddha and the gods, and everyone is free, open, and harmonious with 
            nature. It really is a beautiful rendition of human and nature living in harmony. 
            We hope you enjoy this dance!
